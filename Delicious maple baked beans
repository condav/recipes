Delicious Maple Baked Beans

2 Tbsp oil
2 medium yellow onions, diced very small
5 cloves of garlioc, minced
4 medium tomatoes
1/4 cup fancy molasses  (NOT BLACKSTRAP>>>> VERY IMPORTANT)
1/4 cup maple syrup (the good stuff. B grade at worst, none of that aunt 
jemima crap)
2 Tbsp fresh ground mustard seed
1/4 tsp allspice
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp salt 
a generous peppering
2 bayleaves
3 cans of navy or great northern beans. you can use any beans, but these 
are the optimal ones for the proper texture. should be ~5 cups 

*optional* if you like spice, add some chilies. big fan of smoked 
chipotle if you have them. 

if dry beans, measure ~2.5 cups and soak overngith, then drain soaking 
water. boil for 40 mins, skimming off foam and takign out floaters. 

fry onions on medium low until golden brown. then fry a little longer
make a cavity in the onions, pour in a bit more oil and add minced 
garlic to the oily spot and fry until golden brown. add all spices and 
let cook for a minute
preheat over to 350
add tomatoes (diced) and simmer for 20 mins, or longer if you want a 
more concentrated tomato flavour. add the bayleaves once the tomatoes 
begin to lose structural integrity. 
add cooked beans to pot, and put in the oven for an hour. stir halfway, 
and if they look very wet, leave the top ever so slightly ajar to let 
steam escape

I genuinely hope someone checks this recipe. if you do, all power to you 
and enjoy my beans. i have worked many years perfecting this recipe
